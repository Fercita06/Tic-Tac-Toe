Aim of the challenge
1.	A working Game: The main task is to create a Game not only will this test your understanding of JavaScript but how you break down a problem.
2.	Practice using Git and GitHub flow: We want you to get as much practice as possible using git, GitHub and the command line. (We are upping the stakes... 25 commits)
Requirements •
 • You must have at least 25 Git commits for the project and repo on GitHub 
• Your JS code must be formatted as functions or Classes! 
• You must use click or keypress events in JavaScript to trigger the events in the game. (No refreshing to start the game again!!) 
• We would like you to take a Mobile first approach to the implementation. It needs to work on different device widths. 
• Add a link to this project on your portfolio – this is your first chance to really show off your web skills
Rules of the game

The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O.
Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. 
The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. 
When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
